# Okay, I made this, but How did I do that?

From my blog:  
  - https://litdream.blogspot.com/2014/12/maze-generating-in-c-like-lumosity.html

But, How did I figure this out?
So, I run recursive of genMaze.
( Init by all blocked grid.  Then, step to unvisited random neighbor,
  starting from beginning to end. )


Initialize with all 0:  Locate cell by X, Y method ( %, / )
