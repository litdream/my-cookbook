## C

Main goal is to learn how to bind unit-tests with C program.
I will use google-test, since this is:
  1. industry proven
  2. supports both C and C++


Okay, I overestimated my confidence :)
I know, I used to be proficient in C, but not writing 10 years of real logic, it is easy to make a mistake.

Luckily, these days, LLM(Gemini) can produce unittest for me, which makes life much easier.

And, LLM is great.  Simple Makefile saved my keystrokes.
